<h2>What Are eSports?</h2>
<p><img src="pacific4/homepage.jpg" width="480" height="350" alt="gaming tournament"></p>

<p>Since the dawn of time, man has competed against fellow man for gold and glory. Cavemen clubbed each other to death, Spartans raced up and down Greece's hills at heart-thumping pace, and skilled archers and riflemen altered the course of battles. Today, we call such competition 'sport', and we try to be quite civilized about it. So civilized, in fact, that you can now do it from your desk.</p>

<p>Enter, eSports: the professionalisation of video gaming. No longer a pastime of purported basement-dwellers and arcade-loitering youths, gaming is now a valid career choice for a skilled few. Teenagers are earning millions, signing lucrative sponsorship deals, and dating supermodels, all because they can play games really, really well.</p>

<p>But what makes eSports so popular? Gaming, just like any sport, is something people inherently enjoy doing. When you get lots of people doing one thing, talented individuals will emerge. If you like a particular game, it makes sense that you would want to see the very best players of that game compete. It's entertaining and inspiring. And now it's getting the recognition it deserves.</p>
