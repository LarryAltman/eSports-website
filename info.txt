1) Intro to eSports: http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-are-esports-a-beginner-s-guide-to-pro-gaming

Since the dawn of time, man has competed against fellow man for gold and glory. Cavemen clubbed each other to death, Spartans raced up and down Greece's hills at heart-thumping pace, and skilled archers and riflemen altered the course of battles. Today, we call such competition 'sport', and we try to be quite civilized about it. So civilized, in fact, that you can now do it from your desk...

Enter, eSports: the professionalisation of video gaming. No longer a pastime of purported basement-dwellers and arcade-loitering youths, gaming is now a valid career choice for a skilled few. Teenagers are earning millions, signing lucrative sponsorship deals, and dating supermodels, all because they can play games really, really well.

But what makes eSports so popular? Gaming, just like any sport, is something people inherently enjoy doing. When you get lots of people doing one thing, talented individuals will emerge. If you like a particular game, it makes sense that you would want to see the very best players of that game compete. It’s entertaining and inspiring. And now it’s getting the recognition it deserves.

2)  The rise of eSports: http://adanai.com/esports/

Competitive gaming has existed almost as long as video games themselves. Even the earliest arcade games inspired some fierce competition. Early on, a lot of that competition took the form of friends challenging each other to best their high scores, but it didn’t take long for organized tournaments to begin popping up.

Atari held the first video game competition, the Space Invaders Tournament, in 1980. It attracted more than ten thousand participants. This tournament, and others like it in following years, sowed the seeds of what would eventually become eSports.

The 1990s saw the rise of PC gaming, and along with this came the first true eSports competitions. 1997’s Red Annihilation tournament for the first person shooter (FPS) “Quake” is widely considered to have been the first real instance of eSports, drawing over 2,000 participants. The winner received a Ferrari previously owned by John Carmack, lead developer for “Quake.” Major League Gaming (MLG) launched in 2002 and is now the largest and most successful of the eSports leagues, featuring numerous games in a variety of genres – from shooters to RTS games – and offering lavish prize pools.

MLG was also the first tournament to be televised in North America, with a 2006 “Halo 2” series being shown on the USA Network, though it did not succeed in establishing a major television presence over the long haul.

These days MLG, like most eSports tournaments, is primarily viewed online, though it draws huge numbers. The 2012 spring championship brought in over four million viewers, even beating “real” sporting events, like the 2012 NBA All-Star Game, in certain key demographics.



3) The games: http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-are-esports-a-beginner-s-guide-to-pro-gaming

There’s no definitive list of games that are good for eSports. The beauty of the industry is that in any game where there’s competition to be had, gamers will surely find a way to battle it out. That said, there are some titles that stand out above the rest in the professional circuit.

League of Legends

League of Legends is arguably the most popular title in the professional gaming circuit right now. The 2014 World Championships was the most viewed eSports event of the year. Its popularity largely stems from the game’s sprawling player base. Recent figures are hard to come by, however. The last official stats from Riot came in January 2014, with the studio revealing that 67 million gamers were playing the title each month. What’s more, 27 million users play at least one game daily, and peak daily figures total around 7.5 million. Social gaming site Raptr claims League of Legends holds a 19.97% share of PC games played in January this year, which puts it in top spot for the world’s most popular game.

Counter-Strike

The original Counter-Strike launched in 1999, and has been a staple of PC gaming ever since. This enduring popularity helped grow the game’s competitive scene, with the original title now having awarded over $10 million in prize funding over 540 tournaments. Its sequel, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, launched in 2012, has seen similar success, with competitions doling out over $4 million across 615 tournaments – that’s over just three years.

StarCraft 2

The StarCraft series is one held in high esteem in the professional gaming world. That’s because the skill level required to play at the top end of StarCraft is exceptionally difficult to achieve. It’s also important to note that South Korea has a huge stranglehold on StarCraft and StarCraft 2 in terms of eSports. Of the top 20 highest earning players for StarCraft 2, 19 are from South Korea. It’s long been seen as the most popular game in the country, and many see it as the national sport.

4) Are eSports a 'real sport'? : http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/09/espn-esports-league-of-legends-dota

eSports took a huge step toward mainstream coverage in July when ESPN broadcast The International 4, the world championship of the popular computer game Dota 2. TI4, which sold out the KeyArena in Seattle, even made the front page of ESPN.com. It may come as a bit of a surprise, then, that ESPN president John Skipper dismissed eSports as a whole during a media conference in New York. Skipper was asked about Amazon’s nearly $1 billion purchase of the video game streaming platform Twitch, which as of now is the site most viewers use to watch professionals play games like League of Legends and Dota 2.

“It’s not a sport — it’s a competition. Chess is a competition. Checkers is a competition. Mostly, I’m interested in doing real sports.”

Skipper’s rationale that the professional play of video games is a mere competitions may have held up 15 years ago, but there are eSports that mirror “real sports” in nearly every single way in 2014.

Take League of Legends, for example. In the United States, Riot Games runs an 8-team league that plays 28-game seasons before moving onto an NBA-style playoff. The worst teams in the league can be relegated, much like teams in the English Premier League. Players swap teams (and can be traded) in the offseason just like in any other sport. At the end of the year, the best teams from each region in the world will meet for a championship final that’s not unlike the World Cup. eSports teams have fanbases and rivalries just like any “real sports” teams, and hundreds of thousands of people watch Riot’s League Championship Series every week.

Even if Skipper isn’t willing to call eSports “sports,” it’d be silly for ESPN to dismiss them from a business perspective. More people watched the League of Legends Season 3 final than the NBA Finals or the World Series. eSports is exploding in popularity, and it only makes sense for ESPN to latch on.
